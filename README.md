#Arduino Starter Project - The Spaceship

This is a project from my Arduino starter series.

In this project I'm going to make a spaceship hyperdrive, well not really but this project is from the Arduino Projects Book and it's an awesome learning experience on the way to Arduino mastery. 

My code for this example greatly differs from the example provided in the Arduino Projects Book, I decided to use the [Bounce2 library](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2) to set the button up easier. It makes life easier when dealing with push buttons.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to grasp the basics of Arduino programming and prototyping. Enjoy!

######Project Requirements
Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
USB cable to program Arduino
Breadboard
Three LEDS (Two red and one green)
Three 220 Ohm Resistors
Two 10k Resistors
One Pushbutton
Wires to power the components on the breadboard
